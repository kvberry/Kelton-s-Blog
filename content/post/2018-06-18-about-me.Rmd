My name is Kelton Berry and I am an 19-year old aspiring Data Scientist from Washington, DC. Iâ€™m currently creating this from Cape Town, South Africa as part of the iXperience Data Science Program. Back in the States, I am rising Sophomore at the College of William and Mary, studying Data Science with a minor in Economics. Some of my interests include cooking, sports and 3-D printing.
